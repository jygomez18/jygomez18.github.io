# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Jacob Gomez and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer engineering.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorites because it is the first coding I did in C++.
    I was able to learn how to use commands and how to use GitHub as well for
    the first time. It was fantastic to know that there is a community that
    can help me with my codes.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 is a favorite because it intrigued me how you can make
    patterns in a code. In this lab, I was able to make a pattern without
    copying and pasting. Initially, I thought the only way to make patterns
    was by copying and pasting but I learned using a loop could make it easier.
